# Uncertainty Quiz
This quiz is inspired by David Spiegelhalter (2023): The Art of Uncertainty, chapter 2. 

# Requirements
An installed version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and (RStudio)[https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/].

# Use
1. Download: Just click on the green button "code" in the top right corner and download the repository.
2. Open: After extracting the files, you can simply click open the session by clicking on uncertainty_quiz.Rproj.
3. Start the quiz: Open the file *quiz.R* and then press source (or press Strg + Alt + R).

# Rules
Consider the questions listed below. In each case (either A or B) is the correct answer. The rules are simple.
  1. Decide which answer you feel is most likely to be correct.
  2. Quantify your confidence on a scale from 5 to 10. So if you are certain A is correct then you should give A 10/10. But if you are only around 70% sure, than give 7/10. If you have no clue then give 5/10 to either choice.
  3. No cheating!
